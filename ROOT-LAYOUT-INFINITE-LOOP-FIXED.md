# INFINITE LOOP ERROR FIXED - ROOT LAYOUT

## Problem Summary
The application was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in the root layout, specifically in the Radix UI Presence component. This was causing the entire application to crash with infinite re-renders.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to the `useToast` hook in `/src/hooks/use-toast.ts`. The problem was in this useEffect:

```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
React.useEffect(() => {
  listeners.push(setState)
  return () => {
    const index = listeners.indexOf(setState)
    if (index > -1) {
      listeners.splice(index, 1)
    }
  }
}, [state])  // ← This dependency on 'state' caused infinite loops!
```

### Why This Caused Infinite Loops:
1. The useEffect depends on `state`
2. When `setState` is called (to update toasts), it changes `state`
3. Since `state` changes, the useEffect runs again
4. This creates a new listener and changes state again
5. This creates an infinite cycle of state updates

## Solution Applied

Fixed the dependency array to be empty:

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED CODE (after fix)
React.useEffect(() => {
  listeners.push(setState)
  return () => {
    const index = listeners.indexOf(setState)
    if (index > -1) {
      listeners.splice(index, 1)
    }
  }
}, [])  // ← Empty dependency array prevents infinite loops!
```

### Why This Fix Works:
1. The useEffect only runs once when the component mounts
2. It sets up the listener subscription without depending on state changes
3. The cleanup function still works properly to remove listeners
4. No infinite re-renders occur

## Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Fixed useEffect dependency array

## Technical Impact
This fix resolves:
- ❌ "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in root layout
- ❌ Application crashes due to infinite re-renders
- ❌ Radix UI Presence component infinite loops
- ❌ Toast system causing layout instability

## Additional Context
This was the second infinite loop issue discovered:
1. **First issue**: MenuItemDialog infinite loop (already fixed)
2. **Second issue**: Root layout useToast infinite loop (fixed in this update)

Both issues were related to improper useEffect dependency management in React components.

## Verification Steps
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any page in the application
3. Verify no console errors about "Maximum update depth exceeded"
4. Test toast notifications work properly
5. Confirm application renders without infinite loops

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The infinite loop error in the root layout has been successfully fixed by correcting the useToast hook's useEffect dependency array.
