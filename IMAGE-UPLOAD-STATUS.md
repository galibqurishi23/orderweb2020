## 🔍 **POSSIBLE ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue A: Browser Caching**

- **Solution**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)

- **Solution**: Use smaller images (under 1MB) in JPG/PNG format

### **Issue C: Network/API Errors**
- **Symptom**: Upload works but save fails
- **Solution**: Check browser console for API errors

### **Issue D: Database Connection**
